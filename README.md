# Cookie-clicker

A simple Cookie Clicker game using vanilla JS
This time I revised **Week 3** material, where I practiced:

- Using `setInterval()` and timers ‚è±
- DOM manipulation with `document.getElementById()` and `createElement()`
- Handling events like `onclick`
- Storing and retrieving data with `localStorage`
- Working with async functions and API integration

It helped me reinforce the fundamentals of interactive front-end logic without relying on frameworks.
